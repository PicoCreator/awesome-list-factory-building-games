# Defining Factory Building Games

Because the genre is not "strictly" defined and established, we would be using the following as our game definition.

In an FBG, players are typically expected to be ....

- Constructing and expanding a large base of multiple building blocks, which are ...
- Connected together to build products using an evergrowing continous supply of materials ...
- To continously feed a very intensive "resource sink" (the games goal) ...
- Which can run automatically without the player interaction for long periods of time

Note: That conveyor belts, by definition is not a requirement

# Literal Factory Building Game
These are typically inspired by real world factories. And tend to be 
- More "puzzle" like in nature, as each factory tends to be limited in space. 
- There is also reduced emphasis, on creating the factories that make building parts, 
- With an increased emphasis on "money" and "economy" which all goods can be bought and sold for.
